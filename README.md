Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1.Creating the tableView, I don't understand when certain functions are called and what certain methods mean
2.asynchronous behavior of the app, when are methods called whats calling them

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The challenge of this app was using the experience from creating the Flixter app and applying it to building this app, there were some parts I got stuck. 
Another challenge I ran into was misspelling a method I wanted to call.
